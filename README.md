# Dataset
here are 2 datasets of audios, the first one is the the English dataset which is all the files expect the arabic_fake and arabic_real
to create the first dataset and use it download all the audios and compine them in a file then use 80% of these audios as a training set while the remaining 20% for testing

the Arbic dataset is by compining the files with the English that you already have to create the mixed dataset and as before 80% is for training and 20% for testing
